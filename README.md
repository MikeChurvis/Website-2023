# Website-2023

It is June 2023. I have decided to rebuild my website yet again. Architectural simplicity and ease of development will be the foci of this iteration.

## Development

Nothing will be included in this project without a clearly defined rationale.

### Environment

I'm using Astro because I want a static site that's easily extensible.

I'm using Sass because I prefer BEM as a CSS coding style, and Sass's parent selector and nesting handle it well.

I'm using Tailwind's Preflight to remove the default browser styles.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
